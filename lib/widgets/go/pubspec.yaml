# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:

    - assets/images/splash_logo.png

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MyriadPro_Black.ttf
          weight: 800

        - asset: assets/fonts/MyriadPro_Bold.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/MyriadPro_Italic.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/MyriadPro_Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/MyriadPro-Semibold.otf

          weight: 400
  #   - family: Schyler

  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
